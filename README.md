# Project Structure

This project is a monorepo with 3 packages: a NodeJS server called
@fipeseeker/server, an Angular front-end called @fipeseeker/web and an eslint
configuration package called @fipeseeker/eslint-config-fipeseeker. You can find
information on how to run the application on each separate package (no setup is
required for the eslint package).
